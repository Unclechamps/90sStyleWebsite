      <h3>Airbnb enters partnership with Puerto Rico</h3>
      <p><i>by Gay Nagle Myers - TravelWeekly.com</i></p>

      <p>Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky have partnered to drive tourism to the island as it continues to rebuild after the hurricanes last September.</p>

      <p>As part of the partnership, Airbnb launched its Experiences product on the island, which helps visitors enjoy the authentic Puerto Rico through activities hosted by locals.</p>

      <p>Airbnb will donate its fees from trips booked in Puerto Rico for the next three months to various organizations, including All Hands and Hearts, a nonprofit volunteer relief group.</p>

      <p>Airbnb and Puerto Rico plan to launch a destination-marketing campaign to highlight the diverse experiences available to visitors.</p>

      <p>"Puerto Rico has long been a top destination for travelers looking to experience its rich culture, beautiful scenery and incredible hospitality," Chesky said. "The island's determination in the face of many challenges has surprised and amazed us. We look forward to working with these important partners to unlock the magic of Puerto Rico for more travelers and empower businesses and locals to build an even stronger travel industry than before the hurricane."</p>

      <p>Rossello said that leveraging the power of the Airbnb platform will increase the visibility of Puerto Rico as a travel destination, helping to make it more sustainable, diverse and beneficial to its residents.</p>

      <p>Airbnb's business in Puerto Rico has rebounded since the hurricanes. Since October 2017, nearly 3,000 hosts in Puerto Rico have welcomed 112,000 guests. The launch of Airbnb Experiences will contribute even more to the local economy.</p>

      <p>Close to 50 Experiences are available across the island, ranging from a sunset sail in San Juan Bay and hiking in a nature reserve to touring San Juan's nightlife with a local musician.</p>
